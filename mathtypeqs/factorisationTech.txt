give a number n  check if its a prime
-one way is to just check till n-1 and if a divisior is available
    -o(n)

- better method O(root(n))
     
suppose a number N  - is not prime 
        - that suggests it can be expressed in a way where
        - it is the product of some prime no.s
        -like 140 = 5^1 . 7^1 . 2^2

        -now we can say that primeno. P1(D) = N 
        -D being the rest of primes 
        -we can also say that for this to work P1 or D < root(n)
        cuz if both are greater then product of them cant be more than N

        - so we can just loop till root n instead n as we will eventually in that range 
        - cuz either one will be less than root N
        -and if dont find anything than we can say its prime cuz all cant 
        be greater than rootn 

-Find all the divisors of a number n
        - similarly  a number can have n at most 2(root(n));
        -for every no. in rootn to n we will a corresponding divisor in 
        -0-rootn

-factorize a number n 
        -12 -> 2*2*3 ,60 - >2.2.3.5
        -12 - > [2:2 , 3 : 1 ]

        -if a number n has p1,p2,p3.... prime factors 
            - only one of these can be more than rootn
            - cuz if there are two more than rootn then the product itself will go above N
