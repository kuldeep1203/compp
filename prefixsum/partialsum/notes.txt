prefix Sum

Definition: Prefix Sum, also known as cumulative sum, is a technique used in array processing where each element of an array stores the sum of all the preceding elements, including itself. This precomputation allows for efficient and quick retrieval of cumulative sums for various subarrays.

Example: Given an array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the prefix sum array P would be [1, 3, 6, 10, 15], where P[i] represents the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i].

Partial Sum

Partial sum is a technique used to efficiently compute the sum of elements in a range of an array. Instead of repeatedly iterating through the array for each query or range sum computation, partial sum involves precomputing cumulative sums and then using these precomputed values to quickly calculate the sum of any range.
Problem Statement:

Given an array A of size N, initially all 0's. There are Q queries of the form: +LRx -> add x to all indices in the range [L, R]. After all queries, you need to find the final array.

l -> +x 
r -> -x
